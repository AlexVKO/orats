[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/orats.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/orats)

##### Note
This readme file is based off the master version of orats. If you want accurate documentation then make sure to select the branch for the latest *gem version* of orats.

## What is orats and what problem does it solve?

It stands for opinionated rails application templates. The templates include solving tedious tasks that you would do for most projects. It handles creating a rails application with a bunch of opinions and optionally an ansible inventory/playbook so you can provision your servers and deploy your apps effortlessly.

## What version of Rails and Ruby are you targeting?

#### Rails 4.1.x and Ruby 2.1.x

Gems will also be updated once they are proven to work on the target rails/ruby versions. The gems are locked using the pessimistic operator `~>` to ensure your installation works over time as long as rubygems.org's API is working.

`gem install orats`

Or if you already have orats then run `gem update orats` to upgrade to the latest version.

## Commands

Here is an overview of the available commands. You can find out more information about each command and flag by running  `orats help <command name>` from your terminal. You can also type `orats` on its own to see a list of all commands.

- **Create a new orats project**:
    - `orats project <TARGET_PATH> --pg-password foo`
    - Configuration:
        - Optionally takes: `--pg-location [localhost]`
        - Optionally takes: `--pg-username [postgres]`
        - Optionally takes: `--redis-location [localhost]`
        - Optionally takes: `--redis-password []`
    - Template:
        - Optionally takes: `--template []`
        - Optionally takes: `--custom []`
    - Project:
        - Optionally takes: `--skip-ansible [false]`
        - Optionally takes: `--skip-server-start [false]`

- **Create an ansible inventory**:
    - `orats inventory <TARGET_PATH>`

    - `orats playbook <TARGET_PATH>`
    - Template:
        - Optionally takes: `--custom []`

files**:
    - `orats diff [options]`
    - Optionally takes: `--galaxyfile []`
    - Optionally takes: `--playbook []`
    - Optionally takes: `--hosts []`
    - Optionally takes: `--inventory []`

- **Get a list of available orats templates**:
    - `orats templates`

### Project

The project command kicks off a new orats project. It will always use the 
base template and optionally allows you to provide the `--template foo` flag 
where `foo` would be an available template provided by orats.

You can also supply your own custom template which is explained in the 
[custom template](#custom) section.

Get started by checking out what the [base template](#base) provides.

### Inventory

The project command automatically creates an inventory for you but it also 
has an optional flag to skip doing it by providing `--skip-ansible`.

In case you decided to `--skip-ansible` or decided to delete your inventory 
from a really old project to let orats generate a new one for you then you can
 generate a new inventory on its own.

You may also consider using this command if you happen to use ansible but are
 not interested in the orats project because here is what it does:

#### Features

- Create an `inventory` folder
    - Create a `hosts` files
        - Populate it with a few groups used by an orats project
    - Create a `group_vars/all.yml` file
        - Populate it with a bunch of configuration for an orats project
- Create a `secrets` folder
    - Generate strong passwords for:
        - Your postgres user
        - Your redis server
        - Your mail account
    - Generate tokens for:
        - Rails
        - Devise
        - Devise pepper
    - Create a single private/public ssh keypair
        - This could be used to send to your servers
    - Create self signed ssl certificates to test/support ssl
    - Create a monit pem file for its optional http interface over ssl

#### Try the inventory command

`orats inventory myinventory`

### Playbook

Building your application is only one piece of the puzzle. If you want to ship your application you have to host it somewhere. You have a few options when it comes to managed hosts like Heroku but they tend to be very expensive if you fall out of their free tier.

The playbook template creates an ansible playbook that will provision a **ubuntu 12.04 LTS server**. It can be hosted anywhere as there are no hard requirements on any specific host.

#### Server breakdown

Everything is broken up into ansible roles so you can quickly scale out horizontally or by splitting up your server groups such that your database is on a separate server than your application.

- **Security**:
    - Logging into the server is only possible with an ssh key
    - Root login is disable
    - fail2ban is setup and configurable
    - ferm (firewall) is setup to block any ports not exposed by you
    - All stack specific processes are running with less privileges than root
- **User**:
    - A single deploy user is created
- **Services and runtimes**:
    - Postgres
    - Redis
    - NodeJS
    - Ruby
- **Process management**:
    - Your rails app and sidekiq have `init.d` scripts
    - Your rails app and sidekiq are monitored using `monit`

#### Playbook FAQ

##### What is the Galaxyfile?

It is similar to what a Gemfile is for ruby.

When you generate a playbook it will create a `roles` folder inside of the 
target path you specified. The roles folder will contain all of the above 
roles.

When you run the playbook it will use these files when it provisions
 your server(s).
 
This allows you to easily update the versions of each ansible role without 
having to download a new version of orats.

##### How do I update the roles for an existing playbook?

Just run `orats playbook myplaybook` and it will overwrite 
the roles in `myplaybook/roles` using the versions supplied in your 
`Galaxyfile`. This is useful to run when a role requires a bug fix or new features were added.

Since the roles are self contained in the playbook this allows you to have 
multiple playbooks with certain role versions in case you have older orats 
projects which require older role versions.

### Role

The role command generates an ansible role with a few opinions. The 
`ansible-galaxy` command that ships with ansible already comes with an `init`
 function but the formatting of the files wasn't to my liking.
 
I also wanted it to add in tests using travis-ci and setup a basic 
idempotence test for all new roles.

#### Changes vs ansible-galaxy init

All of the changes have git commits to go with them. After generating a role you
 can type `git reflog` to get a list of changes.

- **Core changes**:
    - Add travis-ci tests
    - Remove the `vars` folder
    - Add `LICENSE` (MIT)
    - Add `.gitignore`
- **meta/main.yml**:
    - Automatically fill in the author name based on your git name
- **README.md**:
    - Add a travis badge
    - Add a section to link back to your role on the official ansible galaxy
    - Automatically fill in your repo name, role name and name where necessary
    - Add instructions for using the role in an example playbook
    - Add a todo list for you to make the role your own

#### Try the role command

##### Basic

`orats role your_github_user_name.myrole`

##### Custom repo name

`orats role your_github_user_name.mynewrole --repo-name ansible-mynewrole`

The custom repo name is probably what you'll want to use all the time if you 
plan to make your roles open source. For example my roles are named things like `nickjj.postgres` and `nickjj.rails`. However my repos are named `ansible-postgres` and `ansible-rails`.

When you submit your role to the galaxy you would use `rails` as the 
optional name for your role.

### Diff

The goal of the diff command is to compare your orats generated files with 
the latest version to see what differences there are between the 2.

You can compare nothing in which case it just gives you back your version of 
the orats gem vs the latest gem version or you can add paths to 1 or all of the 
files below.

##### Galaxyfile

When you supply the `--galaxyfile` flag along with a path to your `Galaxyfile` 
it will show you a list of missing, outdated and extra roles with the versions.

##### Playbook

When you supply the `--playbook` flag along with a path to your 
`site.yml` file it will show you a list of missing or extra roles.

##### Hosts

When you supply the `--hosts` flag along with a path to your `hosts` file it 
will show you a list of missing or extra groups.

##### Inventory

When you supply the `--inventory` flag along with a path to your 
`group_vars/all.yml` file it will show you a list of missing or extra variables.

#### Wait, there is an easier way to compare everything

If you kept the default file names for the files orats generated then you can pass in the path to your inventory directory and playbook directory and it will compare everything for you.

#### Try the diff command

##### Individual files

`orats diff -g /path/to/playbook/Galaxyfile -p /path/to/playbook/site.yml -h 
/path/to/project/inventory/hosts -i /path/to/project/inventory/group_vars/all.yml`

##### Shortcut

`orats diff -i /path/to/my/project/inventory -p /path/to/playbook`

### Templates

Return a list of available templates to choose from.

#### Try the templates command

`orats templates`

## Available templates

### Base

This is the starter template that every other template will append to. I feel like when I make a new project, 95% of the time it includes these features and when I do not want a specific thing it is much quicker to remove it than add it.

#### Changes vs the standard rails project

All of the changes have git commits to go with them. After generating a project you can type `git reflog` to get a list of changes.

#### Try the base template

`orats project myapp --pg-password foo`

#### Base FAQ

##### What is `--pg-password`?

Orats will automatically start your server (you can turn this off with a flag) and also run database migrations or generators depending on what you're doing.

In order to do this it must know your postgres location, username and password. By default it will use localhost for the *location* and *postgres* as the username but if you need to supply those values because yours are different you can use `--pg-location foo` and `--pg-username bar`.

##### Does your redis server use a password?

If your redis server is configured to use a password then you must also pass in `--redis-password foo`.

##### What's with the directory structure?

Let's say you were to generate a new project at *~/tmp/myapp*, then you would get the following paths:

```
~/tmp/myapp/inventory
~/tmp/myapp/secrets
~/tmp/myapp/services
```

The **inventory** path contains the ansible inventory files for this project. This would be where your host addresses go along with configuration settings for this project.

The **secrets** path contains the passwords for various things as well as ssh keypairs and ssl certificates. This path should be kept out of version control. You could also go 1 extra step and encrypt this directory locally.

The **services** path contains your rails application. I like to call it services because you might have multiple services in 1 project.

If you run the command with `--skip-ansible` you will not get the inventory and services.

<a name="base-what-do-i-need-to-configure-for-development"></a>
##### What do I need to configure for development?

Pretty much everything is contained within environment variables. They are stored in the `.env` file located in the root directory of the rails application. It should be self explanatory. This file is also added to `.gitignore`.

<a name="base-what-do-i-need-to-configure-for-production"></a>
##### What do I need to configure for production?

If you are using ansible then you should open `inventory/group_vars/all.yml` and take a peek. Everything there has comments. Assuming you have everything hosted on 1 server then at minimum you will only need to change `rails_deploy_git_url` to get going.

The above variable is the repo where your code is contained. Ansible will clone that repo in an idempotent way.

You will also need to put the correct server IP(s) in `inventory/hosts`. At this point that's all you need to change to successfully provision a server. 

There are many other variables that you would likely change too such as adding your google analytics UA, S3 keys and all of the mail settings.

You may also want to tinker with the following values for performance reasons based on your server(s).

```
  DATABASE_POOL: 25

  PUMA_THREADS_MIN: 0
  PUMA_THREADS_MAX: 16

  # ensure there are always at least 2 workers so puma can properly do phased restarts
  PUMA_WORKERS: "{{ ansible_processor_cores if ansible_processor_cores > 1 else 2 }}"

  SIDEKIQ_CONCURRENCY: 25
```

### Auth

This is the auth template which gets merged into the base template. It contains a basic authentication setup using devise and pundit.

#### Changes vs the base template

All of the changes have git commits to go with them. After generating a project you can type `git reflog` to get a list of changes.

- **Core**:
    - Handle authentication with `devise`
    - Handle devise e-mails with `devise-async`
    - Handle authorization with `pundit`
    - Add `app/policies` with a basic pundit policy included
- **Config**:
    - Add devise related environment variables
    - Set the session timeout to 2 hours
    - Expire the auth token on timeout

    - Add model tests for `Account`

#### Try the auth template

`orats project myauthapp --template auth --pg-password foo`

#### Auth FAQ

##### What do those flags do?

You should read the [try the base template](#try-the-base-template) section to get an idea of what they do.

<a name="auth-what-do-i-need-to-configure-for-development"></a>
##### What do I need to configure for development?

You may want to change `ACTION_MAILER_DEVISE_DEFAULT_FROM` in `.env`.

<a name="auth-what-do-i-need-to-configure-for-production"></a>
##### What do I need to configure for production?

You will want to change `ACTION_MAILER_DEVISE_DEFAULT_FROM` in `inventory/group_vars/all.yml`.

### Custom

You can pass custom templates into both the `project` and `playbook` commands
. It works exactly like passing a custom application template to `rails new`.

Pass in a custom template by providing the `--custom` flag along with either a local path or a URL.

Here is a simple example of a custom template:

```
# /tmp/foo.rb

file 'app/components/foo.rb', <<-S
  class Foo
  end
S
```

#### Try the custom template

`orats project /tmp/customexample -p foo --custom /tmp/foo.rb`

#### Custom FAQ

##### Any guides on how to make custom templates?

There's the official [rails guide on custom application templates]
(http://guides.rubyonrails.org/rails_application_templates.html).

You can also view the [orats project templates](https://github.com/nickjj/orats/tree/master/lib/orats/templates) to use as inspiration. All of 
the template files are self contained.
